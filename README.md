## 📌 Problem Statement

Flight delays and cancellations can cause significant financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. This dashboard was developed to help **airline operations managers, airport authorities, and analysts** monitor flight performance in real-time and identify problem areas that impact operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

This **Flight Status Dashboard** enables:
- 🚀 Real-time monitoring of flight departures and arrivals.
- 📍 Route-specific delay tracking.
- 🛫 Carrier-wise delay and cancellation analysis.
- 📉 Operational KPIs for reducing turnaround time and optimizing scheduling.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

**Step 1**: Imported the flight status dataset into Power BI.

**Step 2**: Cleaned and prepared the data in Power Query:
- Removed missing/null values.
- Corrected data types for time and date formats.

**Step 3**: Created DAX measures and calculated columns for:
- Flight delay categories.
- % of delayed, on-time, and cancelled flights.
- Average delay duration per route and carrier.

**Step 4**: Designed visuals for:
- KPI cards for status distribution.
- Bar charts for carrier performance.
- Route-level delay heatmaps.
- Trend lines for monthly flight trends.

**Step 5**: Applied interactive filters for Airport, Carrier, Flight Status, and Month.

**Step 6**: Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for enterprise access.
